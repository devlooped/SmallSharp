Create, edit and run multiple C# top-level programs in the same project üòç

## Why

C# [top-level programs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements) 
allow a very intuitive, simple and streamlined experience for quickly spiking or learning C#. 

One missing thing since their introduction in Visual Studio is that you can only have one such 
top-level program in a project. This means that in order to prototype or learn a different area 
of .NET, you'd be forced to either replace your previous top-level program or change it to be a 
non-compile item somehow so you can keep it around (i.e. rename to a `.txt` or change its build action).

**SmallSharp** allows you to select which file should be the top-level program to run, right from 
the Start button/dropdown (for compilation and launch/debug). Moreover, it will monitor the active 
file you're editing, and automatically make it the startup file for you!

![start button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlooped/SmallSharp/main/assets/img/launchSettings.png)

This list is automatically kept in sync as you add more `.cs` files to the project. When you select 
one target C# file, that becomes the only top-level program to be compiled, so you don't have to 
modify any of the others since they automatically become *None* items.

All compile files directly under the project directory root are considered top-level programs for 
selection and compilation purposes. If you need to share code among them, you can place them in 
subdirectories and those will behave like normal compile items.

## Usage

There is no need to install any Visual Studio extension. SmallSharp works by just installing the 
[SmallSharp](https://nuget.org/packages/SmallSharp) nuget package in a C# console project.

1. Create a new Console project:

![New Project Dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlooped/SmallSharp/main/assets/img/NewConsoleProject.png)

  * Target the recommended framework version (i.e. net8.0 or net10.0):

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

  * Or use latest C# language version if targeting another framework:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net472</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```
 
1. Install the **SmallSharp** nuget package using your preferred method:

  * From the Dependencies node, Manage NuGet Packages dialog:

![New Project Dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlooped/SmallSharp/main/assets/img/NuGetPackage.png)

   * By just adding it directly to the .csproj:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="SmallSharp" Version="*" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

   * Via the dotnet CLI:

```
> dotnet add package SmallSharp
```

   * Via the Package Manager console:

```
PM> install-package SmallSharp
```

3. Now open that Program.cs and make changes to the new concise top-level program such as:

```csharp
using System;
using static System.Console;

WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

Keep adding as many top-level programs as you need, and switch between them easily by simply 
selecting the desired file from the Start button dropdown.

## How It Works

This nuget package leverages in concert the following standalone and otherwise 
unrelated features of the compiler, nuget and MSBuild:

1. The C# compiler only allows one top-level program per compilation.
2. Launch profiles (the entries in the Run dropdown) are populated from the Properties\launchSettings.json file
3. Whenever changed, the dropdown selection is persisted as the `$(ActiveDebugProfile)` MSBuild property in a file 
   named after the project with the `.user` extension
4. This file is imported before NuGet-provided MSBuild targets
5. The `$(DefaultItemExcludesInProjectFolder)` MSBuild property allows excluding items at the project-level from 
   the automatically added items by the SDK.

Using the above features in concert, **SmallSharp** essentially does the following:

* Emit top-level files as a `launchSettings.json` profile and set the `$(ActiveDebugProfile)`.

* Exclude `.cs` files at the project level from being included as `<Compile>` by the default SDK 
  includes and include them explicitly as `<None>` instead so they show up in the solution explorer. 
  This prevents the compiler from causing an error for multiple top-level programs.

* Explicitly include as `<Compile>` only the `$(ActiveDebugProfile)` property value.

This basically mean that this it will also work consistently if you use `dotnet run` from the command-line, 
since the "Main" file selection is performed exclusively via MSBuild item manipulation.
