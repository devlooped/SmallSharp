## Open Source Maintenance Fee

To ensure the long-term sustainability of this project, use of SmallSharp requires an 
[Open Source Maintenance Fee](https://opensourcemaintenancefee.org). While the source 
code is freely available under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/devlooped/SmallSharp/blob/main/license.txt), all other aspects of the 
project --including opening or commenting on issues, participating in discussions and 
downloading releases-- require [adherence to the Maintenance Fee](https://github.com/devlooped/SmallSharp/blob/main/osmfeula.txt).

In short, if you use this project to generate revenue, the [Maintenance Fee is required](https://github.com/devlooped/SmallSharp/blob/main/osmfeula.txt).

To pay the Maintenance Fee, [become a Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/devlooped) at the corresponding OSMF tier (starting at just $10!).

## Overview

C# [top-level programs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements) 
allow a very intuitive, simple and streamlined experience for quickly spiking or learning C#. 
The addition of [file-based apps](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-run-app/) in 
.NET 10 [takes this further](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#file-based-apps) by allowing package references and even MSBuild properties to be 
specified per file:

```csharp
#:package Humanizer@2.14.1
#:property ImplicitUsings=true
#:property Nullable=enable

using Humanizer;

var dotNet9Released = DateTimeOffset.Parse("2024-12-03");
var since = DateTimeOffset.Now - dotNet9Released;

Console.WriteLine($"It has been {since.Humanize()} since .NET 9 was released.");
```

Editing these standalone files in VSCode, however, is suboptimal compared with the full C# 
experience in Visual Studio. In Visual Studio, though, you can only have one top-level program 
in a project, and as of now, you cannot leverage the `#:package` and `#:property` directives 
at all.

**SmallSharp** allows dynamically selecting the file to run, right from the Start button/dropdown 
(for compilation and launch/debug). It also automatically restores the `#:package` references so 
the project system can resolve them, and even emits the `#:property` directives if present to customize 
the build as needed.

![start button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlooped/SmallSharp/main/assets/img/launchSettings.png)

This list is automatically kept in sync as you add more `.cs` files to the project. When you select 
one target C# file, that becomes the only top-level program to be compiled, so you don't have to 
modify any of the others since they automatically become *None* items. 

> [!TIP]
> An initial build after selection change migh be needed to restore the packages and compile the 
> selected file, unless you're using the SDK mode for SmallSharp (see below).

All compile files directly under the project directory root are considered top-level programs for 
selection and compilation purposes. If you need to share code among them, you can place additional 
files in subdirectories and those will behave like normal compile items.

## Usage

SmallSharp works by just installing the 
[SmallSharp](https://nuget.org/packages/SmallSharp) nuget package in a C# console project 
and adding a couple extra properties to the project file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>

    <!-- üëá additional properties required in package mode -->
    <ImportProjectExtensionProps>true</ImportProjectExtensionProps>
    <ImportProjectExtensionTargets>true</ImportProjectExtensionTargets>   
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="SmallSharp" Version="*" PrivateAssets="all" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

There are some limitations with this mode, however: 
* You cannot use the `#:sdk` [directive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#file-based-apps) 
  to specify a different SDK per file, since the project file already specifies one.
* CLI-based builds may require multiple passes to restore and build the selected file, since 
  the package is only restored after the first build.
* You must add ImportProjectExtensionProps/ImportProjectExtensionTargets manually, polluting the 
  project file.

So the recommended way to use SmallSharp is via the SDK mode, which results in a more streamlined 
and seamless experience across IDE and CLI builds:

```xml
<Project Sdk="SmallSharp/2.2.3">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

The SDK mode will always produce a successful build in a single `dotnet build` pass even if you 
change the `ActiveFile` between builds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If no `#:sdk` directive is provided by a specific C# file-based app, the `Microsoft.NET.SDK` will be 
> used by default in this SDK mode.

Keep adding as many top-level programs as you need, and switch between them easily by simply 
selecting the desired file from the Start button dropdown.

When running from the command-line, you can select the file to run by passing it as an argument to `dotnet run`:

```bash
dotnet run -p:start=program1.cs
```

You can also use the shortcut `-p:s=[FILE]`.

## How It Works

This nuget package leverages in concert the following standalone and otherwise 
unrelated features of the compiler, nuget and MSBuild:

1. The C# compiler only allows one top-level program per compilation.
2. Launch profiles (the entries in the Run dropdown) are populated from the Properties\launchSettings.json file
3. Whenever changed, the dropdown selection is persisted as the `$(ActiveDebugProfile)` MSBuild property in a file 
   named after the project with the `.user` extension
4. This file is imported before NuGet-provided MSBuild targets
5. VS ignores `#:` directives when adding the flag `FileBasedProgram` to the `$(Features)` project property.

Using the above features in concert, **SmallSharp** essentially does the following:

* Emit top-level files as a `launchSettings.json` profile and set the `$(ActiveDebugProfile)`.

* Exclude `.cs` files at the project level from being included as `<Compile>` by the default SDK 
  includes and include them explicitly as `<None>` instead so they show up in the solution explorer. 
  This prevents the compiler from causing an error for multiple top-level programs.

* Explicitly include as `<Compile>` only the `$(ActiveDebugProfile)` property value.

* Emit `#:package` and `#:property` directive to an automatically imported `obj\SmallSharp.targets` file

* SmallSharp MSBuild SDK automatically imports the `SmallSharp.targets` file, which causes a new 
  restore to automatically happen in Visual Studio, bringing all required dependencies automatically.

This basically mean that this it will also work consistently if you use `dotnet run` from the command-line, 
since the "Main" file selection is performed exclusively via MSBuild item manipulation.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to keep the project file to its bare minimum, usually having just the SmallSharp 
> SDK reference, and do all project/package references in the top-level files using the `#:package` and 
> `#:property` directives for improved isolation between the different file-based apps.
